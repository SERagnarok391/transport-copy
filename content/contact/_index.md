I specialize in writing for logistics/supply chain businesses. While the documents in this field tend to include a lot of technical jargon, the point should be easy to understand!

Possible areas I can help you with:

* Training manuals and process documentation (from updating internal Excel spreadsheets to training employees in database software)
* Editing and reorganizing poorly-written or translated product descriptions, web content, or internal documents
* White Papers, Case Studies, Analytics Reports, Technical Articles
* Brochures, Web Content, Marketing Material, Emails, Blog Articles, and Personal Profiles

I have experience in the transportation field as an analyst, where I served as a major point of communication for import suppliers, freight forwarders, and 3PL managers. I wrote process documentation and training materials, as well as distilled difficult concepts across internal and external teams. 

Communication is a major point of failure in both running a business in logistics and keeping your customers happy. You should not miss out on the opportunity to improve the writing for your organization. Contact me so we can get started!
