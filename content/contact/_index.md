I'm Sharon, and I specialize in writing strategic content for logistics/supply chain businesses. While the websites in this field tend to include a lot of technical jargon, the copy should be easy to understand!

I have experience in the transportation field as an analyst, where I served as the major point of communication for import suppliers, freight forwarders, and 3PL managers. 

Communication is a major point of failure in attracting new business in logistics. You should not miss out on the opportunity to get more traffic through great blog posts and web content. Contact me so I can help you out.
