Do you really need to pay attention to content? It might be tempting to think that your organization speaks for itself. You have a clean website, great testimonials, and a blog. 

That’s enough, right? Wrong. 

In 2018, everyone has a web presence. In order to stand out, you also need to provide valuable content, both online and off. It’s a lot more than avoiding misspellings and bad grammar, too. You have to think about your brand, your presence, and the value you are providing to your customer. You are providing value in the supply chain space, right? 

Here’s why you need to pay attention to creating great content.

&nbsp;

**Content sells**

You’ve probably heard that content sells. This is also easy to overlook when many logistics companies are B2B and admittedly pretty behind when it comes to making a good impression on the web. Transportation as an industry has resisted many technological advances. Most of these companies maybe start a blog to get ahead. This is obviously sound advice, as B2B businesses that maintain a blog get [67% more leads](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnrampton/2016/09/21/why-you-cant-afford-to-ignore-blogging-as-part-of-your-online-strategy/#47a90142ab73) than those that don’t. But as more businesses get on board, the type and quality of the content is becoming more and more important. We should probably update this headline to “good content sells”. 

So if you have _great_ content, you’ll be even further ahead than those with good content. And so on.

**Content provides authority**

The only thing better than new leads is getting referrals. One of the best ways to do this is to be seen as an authority in your company’s space. Yes, if you provide an awesome service, you’re likely to get referrals that way. But if you also provide cutting-edge information about supply chain trends, logistics solutions, and new technologies in transportation, you can bet that your readers will benefit from useful information, and will remember you for letting them know. 

In other words, help your clients out before they even become your clients. Provide value with the content that you write, and that investment will pay off with links and referrals.

**Creates a clear, consistent message**

Emphasis on the _clear_. Although I’ve mostly emphasized blog content, other web content is just as important. We all know that the supply chain and logistics space is riddled with technical jargon, poor communication, and confusion about what these businesses actually do. Improving internal communication has been shown time and time again to [help logistics companies improve their bottom line](https://logisticsviewpoints.com/2015/04/30/improved-communication-helps-to-drive-efficiencies-into-transportation-scheduling/). Improved client communication also helps you achieve financial results.

Do your customers know all of your internal jargon? Probably not, so keep it out of your web copy. 

If a potential client immediately knows what you do and why it will benefit them, you are far more likely to convert that client. Keep it simple, keep it direct, and make it easy to understand. That’s great content.

**Builds Trust**

This is what every logistics company wants. Wouldn’t it be great if a client immediately trusted you to provide them with a great service, had fewer up-front questions, and converted quickly?

You can get this done with content. Having a clean website, no spelling or grammar mistakes, and a memorable company logo will only get you so far on their own. Clearly communicate what you do, provide value in your blog as a company within the transportation space, and become a voice of authority. You’ll build your client list and save time (and money) during the sales and onboarding process. 

Clients trust direct and easy-to-read content. Customers associate a straightforward writing voice with honesty, which means that clients are more likely to trust that you will deliver on your promises. 

&nbsp;

The web is becoming more competitive as businesses become convinced that having an online presence pays off. Make sure that you’re providing value with your content, and your business will continue to stand out. Otherwise, it will become harder and harder to attract new clients through a website and blog alone. In supply chain especially, trying to attract customers by speaking in difficult-to-understand language and failing to have a central brand message will make it harder to get the benefits of online marketing.

So, get to tweaking and improving your content. If you don’t, your competitors will.
